# Neural Networks for Pima Indian Data set  

Previously, I was using GBM, Random Forest, GAM etc. model for the Pima Indian Dataset. This repo is for further exploration, considering neural network models.

### Description
1. `model.py` contains the class for multilayer perceptron
2. `data.py` contains script for data processing
3. `helper.py` contains cross validation pipeline
4. `main.ipynb` is a jupyter notebook for the main program.
